The Naomi Project is an open source, technology agnostic platform for developing
always-on, voice-controlled applications!

Naomi **software** integrates different home text-to-speech & speech-to-text
systems, plugins and technologies into a single solution.
It provides the glue for connecting these technologies into an always-on,
voice-controlled application.

You've reached the Naomi documentation, which contains extensive resources for
all users. Naomi releases are divided into three group:

- **Stable** versions (**{{$page.frontmatter.currentVersion}}**) are thoroughly
tested semi-annual official releases of Naomi. Use the stable version for your
production environment if you don't need the latest enhancements and prefer a
robust system.
- **Milestone** versions (**{{$page.frontmatter.currentMilestoneVersion}}**)
are intermediary releases of the next Naomi version, released about once a
month, and they include the new recently added features and bugfixes. They are
a good compromise between the current stable version and the bleeding-edge and
potentially unstable nightly version. Milestones releases are
**Highly Recommended** for most users.
- **Nightly** versions are at most 1 or 2 days old and include the latest code.
Use nightly for testing out very recent changes, but be aware some nightly
versions might be unstable. Use in production at your own risk!

The docs are divided into two catagories, Stable & Dev, Stable docs matching
version **{{$page.frontmatter.currentVersion}}** release and Dev matching
version **{{$page.frontmatter.currentMilestoneVersion}}** release. This is
represented by the dropdown at the **Top Right** of any documentation pages.
Please verify you are viewing the same doc version as your Naomi installation.
All past version documentation is archived on our
[support site](https://support.projectnaomi.com/document/) to view if need be.

- If you are new to Naomi, we recommend to learn a bit about Naomi first before
jumping in - please proceed directly to the [Getting Started](#getting-started)
chapter below!
- If you're an experienced user, the [Download](/download/) page contains links
and installation instructions. The [Manual Configuration Guide](./configuration/)
also contain useful information if you chose to manually configure Naomi. If
you're looking for the documentation of a specific plugins, go to the
[Naomi Plugin Exchange](/plugins/). You can also use the search box above to
find any page on this site.
- If you would like to contribute to the development of Naomi, please refer to
our [Developer Guide](./developer/).

This documentation is always worked on, so expect regular changes. If you feel
that something important is missing, please
[help us improve the documentation](https://github.com/naomiproject/naomi-docs/blob/gh-pages/README.md#contributing-to-the-documentation)!

## Getting Started

Naomi in theory will run on many platforms that include Python, i.e Linux,
Windows and Mac OSx.
You can find specific installation instructions for these and other platforms
in the [Installation Guide](./installation/).
The simplest way to experiment with Naomi is to get a
[Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrypi.org) and install
[Naobian](./installation/naobian.html) - the "hassle-free Naomi setup".
While Naobian offers a streamlined and simplified way to get up and running
quickly, it includes the full git repository of the source code, so you can
review the source of the core application and example plugins as well as start
developing your own plugins.

Along the way, you may have some questions; the Naomi community is here to help.

## The Naomi Community

Naomi is not just software - it is also a **community** of users, contributors
and maintainers, working together on an open-source, interoperable approach to
virtual assistance.
The center of this community is the [Naomi community forum](https://support.projectnaomi.com).
You can search previous conversations and issues to see if your question has
already been answered.
You can post your own question as well (although it is generally considered to
be good etiquette to check fairly thoroughly before posting).
One of the great things about Naomi is that it has an active and responsive
community of developers and maintainers who generally respond quite quickly
to forum questions (these individuals are volunteers who mostly have day jobs,
so please allow up to a couple of days for a response).
We believe you will find that our community works diligently to make newcomers
feel at home.

## Architecture Overview

Naomi is developed in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and mainly based on the
[Jasper](https://jasperproject.github.io/) framework. Naomi is our community's
attempt to support, extend and modernize Jasper.

Naomi is highly modular software that can be extended through "Plugins".
Plugins give Naomi a wide array of capabilities, from User Interfaces, to
different speech to text and text to speech engines, to the ability to interact
with a large and growing number of physical Things.
A small number of core plugins are included with the base Naomi installation,
and you can install more (or publish your own) using the [Naomi Plugin Exchange](/plugins/).
